## Understanding the HR Requirements

The excel data provided by our client Pinali shows the employee data who are working in ATliq Hardware company for the three months i,e Apr- June for the fiscal year 2022.
She wants to analyze attendance data for work from home and work from office to understand preferences and percentages of people present.

 ### Points to keep in mind (As a Data Analyst)
1. It is important to listen more than to talk.
2. Keep the client engaged by asking the right questions.
3. Ask question to understand their short and long term plans
4. Become a STRATEGIC partner, not just a SOLUTION PROVIDER.


## What do we need to find out ?
 1. Working Preference of people(WFH/WFO)
 2. If they are taking frequent WFH on Mondays and Fridays, If yes, what could be the reason?
 3. Understand the pattern of their attendance.
 4. Understand the percentage of employees who are taking WFH.
 5. If the company is providing a hybrid model, like 2 days WFO and 3 days WFH, then on which day can we plan any such group activity so that majority of people are present?
 6. Implement hybrid work model to save cost on infrastructure
 7. Identify employee sick leave patterns to improve sanitization measures
 8. Analyzing data for fall activity planning.
 

## Gathering and Transforming Data
The HR department gathered the data over three months.
1. We did merge the data from all three months.
2. We created a template in Power Bi so that we could replicate the further steps.
3. We created required measures in Power Bi such as Total No. Of Working Days,WFH Count, Present Days etc.
4. It is usually a good practice to group the measures in one place.
5. Understanding the calculate function in DAX is very important.
6. We can also add additional columns to our data using Dax.

During the data transformation we have referred to the following blog post : https://blog.crossjoin.co.uk/2018/07/09/power-bi-combine-multiple-excel-worksheets/?subscribe=success#subscribe-blog-blog_subscription-3
